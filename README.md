## Dead Sea Scrolls
To-do list
 - preprocessing dead sea scrolls:
    - binarization: already done
    - text zone detection: already done
    - line segmentation
 - character segmentation
    - isolated character segmentation; simple, contour-based, probably causes prediction errors on a few connected characters
    - connected character segmentation; uses line-thinning to disconnect distinct characters, somewhat unreliable

## IAM dataset
To-do list
- TrOCR model?
